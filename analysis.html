                    As of 2024, the global generation of electronic waste (e-waste) has reached a staggering 62 million metric tons annually, marking a significant increase in recent years. Despite this massive volume, only a small fraction is effectively recycled. In 2022, about 57.4 million metric tons of e-waste were produced, with only 17% being formally collected and recycled. This rate of recycling is insufficient to handle the growing e-waste burden and falls short of international goals, such as the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) target to recycle 30% of global e-waste by 2023, which was not achieved.
                    The primary challenge in e-waste recycling is its unprofitability. Recycling e-waste involves complex processes to extract valuable metals and materials from devices, which are often chemically and physically bound to other elements. This complexity increases the cost, making recycling less economically viable compared to landfilling or informal processing. Furthermore, a significant portion of e-waste from developed countries is shipped to developing nations, where it is processed under hazardous conditions, impacting the health of workers, especially women and children involved in informal recycling sectors.
                    Valuable elements worth over $50 billion are discarded annually in e-waste. These include rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, and cobalt, which are crucial for various industries, including electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems. However, the economic and logistical challenges of recycling these materials remain significant barriers.
                    Efforts are being made to improve e-waste recycling rates and sustainability. Innovations in recycling technologies and the development of digital supply networks (DSNs) are potential solutions. These DSNs can help manage raw material shortages more efficiently and reduce waste. Additionally, some governments are introducing incentives to promote the extraction of critical materials from e-waste to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce environmental harm.
                    Despite these efforts, without significant advancements and international cooperation, the volume of e-waste is projected to rise to 75 million metric tons by 2030, further exacerbating the environmental and health issues associated with improper e-waste disposal.</p>
